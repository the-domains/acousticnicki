**_Biography_**

. . .Born and raised in southwest Pennsylvania, Nicki has been writing and performing music for more than half her life. After moving to the Philadelphia area in 2002, Nicki found herself impressed by the wealth of opportunity in the local music scene and promptly gave up her day job for a new one: Acoustic Entertainer! As summers approach, you'll find Nicki playing solo shows up and down the Jersey shore and year round performing all over the Philly, NJ, and NY region. 

She is a genuine music fan, and unlike many other acoustic performers in the scene, can actually perform 100% requests. In fact, Nicki even provides laminated song menus including 500+ selections to petition said requests.

[][0]While Nicki works consistently as a cover-based entertainer, she has performed original sets at revered Philadelphia venues, including World Cafe Live, Tin Angel, Legendary Dobbs, and Grape Room. Nicki has also performed at the Atlantic City Beer and Music Festival and Cape May Singer Songwriter.
